== Control Plane Templates
Templates allow a cluster administrator to create reusable configurations that users may extend with their own customizations.
Templates may also inerhit from other templates. As an example, if there are two teams with different control planes, say an
accounting team and a website team, with a development and production configuration, then there could be a template called development
and one called production and individual templates for the accounting and development teams that extend these two configurations with
their own customizations. Individual control planes in the teams can customize these for the actual deployment.

Templates follow the same configuration as a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` so if you get a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` working, you can then
include it as a template. To add custom templates, create a `ConfigMap` called `smcp-templates` in the `openshift-operators` project.
This `ConfigMap` will contain a collection of templates to use. The `ConfigMap` must then be mounted in the operator at
`/usr/local/share/istio-operator/templates/`.

=== Creating the ConfigMap
To create the `ConfigMap`, execute the following as a cluster administrator, substituting <templates-directory> for a directory containing a
collection of `ServiceMeshControlPlane` files to use as templates. The name of the template will match the name of the file. Templates will
inherit from other templates until a template is reached which has an empty template field. Using a template name of `default` will override the
default template for all control planes when no template is specified in a control plane.

For example, create a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` and instead of using `oc apply` to create it in the cluster, save it in a
directory called `<templates-directory>`. Follow the instructions below to create and configure a `ConfigMap` containing this new
template. Additional templates can be added to the `ConfigMap` as desired.

----
$ oc create configmap --from-file=<templates-directory> smcp-templates -n openshift-operators
----

Next, find the Maistra operator `ClusterServiceVersion` name. 

----
$ oc get clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators | grep 'Service Mesh'
maistra.v1.0.0            Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh   1.0.0                Succeeded
----

Edit the `ClusterServiceVersion` to instruct the operator to use the `smcp-templates` `ConfigMap`.

----
$ oc edit clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators maistra.v1.0.0
----

In the editor, add a volume mount and volume to the deployments as shown below.

[source, yaml]
----
 deployments:
    - name: istio-operator
      spec:
        template:
          spec: 
            containers:
              volumeMounts:
                - name: discovery-cache
                  mountPath: /home/istio-operator/.kube/cache/discovery
                - name: smcp-templates
                  mountPath: /usr/local/share/istio-operator/templates/
            volumes:
              - name: discovery-cache
                emptyDir:
                  medium: Memory
              - name: smcp-templates
                configMap:
                  name: smcp-templates
  ...
----

You can now use templates in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` by adding a
`template` parameter to the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`. In the example below,
we are including the `default` template, but you can use any template from the
`smcp-templates` `ConfigMap` as well.

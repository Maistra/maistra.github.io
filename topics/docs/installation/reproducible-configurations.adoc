== Control Plane Templates
Templates follow the same syntax as a *ServiceMeshControlPlane* and allow users to inherit settings in a hierarchical fashion. The operator
comes with a built-in `default` template containing the default settings for OpenShift Service Mesh or Maistra depending on the operator.
To add custom templates, create a ConfigMap called `smcp-templates` in the `openshift-operators` project. This ConfigMap will contain a collection
of templates to use. This ConfigMap must then be mounted in the operator at `/usr/local/share/istio-operator/templates/`.

=== Creating the ConfigMap
To create the ConfigMap, execute the following as a cluster administrator, substituting _templates-directory_ for a directory containing a
collection of *ServiceMeshControlPlane* files to use as templates. The name of the template will match the name of the file. Templates will
inherit from other templates until a template is reached which has an empty template field. Using a name of _default_ will override the
default template when no template is specified in a controlplane.


For example, create a ServiceMeshControlPlane and instead of using `oc apply` to create it in the cluster, save it in a
directory called _templates-directory_. Follow the instructions below to create and configure a ConfigMap using this new
template. Additional templates can be created the same way.

```
 oc create configmap --from-file=templates-directory smcp-templates -n openshift-operators
```
Next, find and edit the operator deloyment in the operator cluster service version to
instruct the operator to use the smcp-templates ConfigMap.

```
oc get clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators | grep 'Service Mesh'
maistra.v1.0.0            Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh   1.0.0                Succeeded

oc edit clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators maistra.v1.0.0
```

In the editor, add a volume mount and volume as shown below.

```
 deployments:
        - name: istio-operator
          spec:
          ...
                    volumeMounts:
                      - mountPath: /home/istio-operator/.kube/cache/discovery
                        name: discovery-cache
                      - name: smcp-templates
                        mountPath: /usr/local/share/istio-operator/templates/
          ...
                volumes:
                  - emptyDir:
                      medium: Memory
                    name: discovery-cache
                  - name: smcp-templates
                    configMap:
                      name: smcp-templates
```

Templates can now be referenced by adding a *template* parameter to the *ServiceMeshControlPlane*.
```
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: minimal-install
spec:
  template: default
```

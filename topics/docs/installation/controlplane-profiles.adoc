== Control Plane Profiles
Profiles allow a cluster administrator to create reusable configurations that users may extend with their own customizations.
Profiles may also inherit from other profiles. As an example, if there are two teams with different control planes, say an
accounting team and a website team with a development and production configuration, then there could be a profile called development
and one called production.  Individual profile would be created for the accounting and development teams that extend these two configurations with
their own customizations. Individual deployments can further customize these configurations. For additional extensibility, multiple profiles can be inherited in a single profile.

Profiles follow the same configuration as a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` so if you get a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` working, you can then
include it as a profiles. To add custom profiles, create a `ConfigMap` called `smcp-templates` in the `openshift-operators` project.
This `ConfigMap` will contain a collection of profiles to use. The `ConfigMap` must then be mounted in the operator at
`/usr/local/share/istio-operator/templates/`.

=== Creating the ConfigMap
To create the `ConfigMap`, execute the following as a cluster administrator, substituting <profiles-directory> for a directory containing a
collection of `ServiceMeshControlPlane` files to use as profiles. The name of the profiles will match the name of the file. Templates will
inherit from other profiles until a profile is reached which has an empty profile field. Using a profile name of `default` will override the
default profile for all control planes when no profile is specified in a control plane.

To create a profile, save a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` in a directory referred to as `<profiles-directory>`.
Follow the instructions below to create and configure a `ConfigMap` containing this new
profile. Additional profiles can be added to the `ConfigMap` as desired.

----
$ oc create configmap --from-file=<profiles-directory> smcp-templates -n openshift-operators
----

Next, find the Maistra operator `ClusterServiceVersion` name.

----
$ oc get clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators | grep 'Service Mesh'
maistra.v2.0.0.1            Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh   2.0.0-1                Succeeded
----

Edit the `ClusterServiceVersion` to instruct the operator to use the `smcp-templates` `ConfigMap`.

----
$ oc edit clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators servicemeshoperator.v2.0.0.1
----

In the editor, add a volume mount and volume to the deployments as shown below.

[source, yaml]
----
 deployments:
    - name: istio-operator
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            containers:
              volumeMounts:
                - name: smcp-templates
                  mountPath: /usr/local/share/istio-operator/templates/
            volumes:
              - name: smcp-templates
                configMap:
                  name: smcp-templates
  ...
----

You can now use profiles in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` by adding a
`profile` parameter to the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`. In the example below,
we are including the `default` profile, but you can use any profile from the
`smcp-templates` `ConfigMap` as well.

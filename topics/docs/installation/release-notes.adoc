== Security Issues

{{% notice warning %}}
Occasionally, security issues are found in Maistra. When issues are discovered, a new release
of OpenShift Service Mesh is made to include fixes for these vulnerabilities. However,
these fixes are not included in a Maistra release until the next general release.

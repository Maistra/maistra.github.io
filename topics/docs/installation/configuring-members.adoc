== Introduction

To associate a project that contains your application with a Maistra Control Plane,
two methods are supported:

* Specify the project in a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` object.
* Add a `ServiceMeshMember` object to the project.

=== ServiceMeshMemberRoll
The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource configures which projects belong to a control plane.
Only projects listed in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` will be affected by the control plane.
Any number of projects can be added, but a project may not exist in more than one control plane.
This resource must be created in the same project as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource
and must be named `default`. An example resource can be seen below:

There might be configurations where routes to pods are no longer working after adding a project to a control plane. Please see the link:../../troubleshooting/troubleshooting_network_policy[network policy trouble shooting guide] to solve the problem.

=== ServiceMeshMember
When the `ServiceMeshMember` is created, it causes the project to be added to
the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` within the control plane project it references.

An example resource can be seen below:

Unlike the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource, which is created by the service mesh
administrator, `ServiceMeshMember` resources are created by service mesh users.
While project administrators are automatically given permission to create the
`ServiceMeshMember` resource in their project, they are not allowed to point it
to any `ServiceMeshControlPlane` until the service mesh administrator explicitly
grants access to the service mesh using RBAC. This is done by modifying the
`mesh-users` `RoleBinding` in the control plane project to specify the users and
groups which should be granted access.

The `mesh-users` `RoleBinding` is created by the Maistra operator after the administrator
creates the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, but the administrator can also
create it beforehand (for example, in the same `oc apply` operation as the
`ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource).

An example of the `RoleBinding` is shown below:

=== Routes Not Working
If you add a project to the mesh, pods of this project might be no longer accessible from the OpenShift Ingress or Router, depending on your network polices. When adding a project to a mesh, a network rule will also be added that allows the OpenShift Ingress or Router to access only pods with the label `maistra.io/expose-route: 'true'`.

If you're using Deployments, you can add the label `maistra.io/expose-route: 'true'` to the pods with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc patch deployment <deployment name> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"maistra.io/expose-route":"true"}}}}}'
----

In certain cases (e.g. when running the OpenShift cluster on VMWare), your ingress controller is running on the host network. In this case, ingress traffic will appear to originate in the `default` project. In this case you might want to add the label `network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress` to the default project. A detailed description can be found link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.html[here].

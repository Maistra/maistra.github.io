=== Routes Not Working
If you add a project to the data plane, pods of this project might be no longer accessible from the OpenShift Ingress or Router, depending on your network polices. Since adding a project to a data plane, a netwok rule will also be added that allows the OpenShift Ingress or Router to access only pods with the label `maistra.io/expose-route: 'true'`.

For deployments you add the label `maistra.io/expose-route: 'true' `to the pods with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc patch deployment <deployment name> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"maistra.io/expose-route":"true"}}}}}'
----

In certain cases i.e run the OpenShift cluster on VMWare, you might need to add the label `network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress` to the default namespace. A detailed description can be found here: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/configuring-networkpolicy.html

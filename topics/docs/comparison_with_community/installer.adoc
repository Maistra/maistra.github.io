Istio-operator is based on the Istio helm charts. Aside from embedding all installation logic into the operator (e.g. removing create-custom-resources.yaml templates), the changes made to the base Istio charts can be found below. 

## Component Modifications

### General

* GODEBUG environment variable settings have been removed from all templates.
* A *maistra-version* label has been added to all resources.
* The *istio-multi* ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding have been removed, as well as the *istio-reader* ClusterRole.
* All Ingress resources have been converted to OpenShift Route resources.

### Galley
* A named *targetPort* has been added to the Galley Service.
* The Galley webhook port has been moved from 443 to 8443.
* The Galley health file has been moved to */tmp/heath* (from */health*)
* The *--validation-port* option has been added to the Galley.

### Sidecar Injector

* Sidecar proxy init containers have been configured as privileged, regardless of *global.proxy.privileged* setting.
* The opt-out mechanism for injection has been modified when *sidecarInjectorWebhook.enableNamespacesByDefault* is enabled.
  Namespaces now opt-out by adding an *istio.openshift.com/ignore-namespace* label to the namespace.
* A named *targetPort* has been added to the Sidecar Injector Service.
* The Sidecar Injector webhook port has been moved from 443 to 8443.

* Jaeger uses Elasticsearch for storage.

### Kiali

* Has been enabled by default.
* Ingress has been enabled by default.
* Updates have been made to the Kiali ConfigMap.
* Updates have been made to the ClusterRole settings for Kiali.
* A demo Secret has been added that will get created using values from *kiali.dashboard.user* and *kiali.dashboard.passphrase*,
  if specified.

## Known Issues

The following are known issues that need to be addressed:

* Istio CustomResourceDefinition resources are not removed during uninstall.
* Updates have not been tested (e.g. modifying a *ServiceMeshControlPlane* resource to enable/disable a component).
* Uninstall is a little sloppy (i.e. resources are just deleted, and not in an intelligent fashion).
* Reconciliation is only performed on the *ServiceMeshControlPlane* resource (i.e. the operator is not watching installed resources,
  e.g. Galley deployment).  This means users may modify those resources and the operator will not revert them (unless
  the *ServiceMeshControlPlane* resource is modified).
* Rollout may hang if configuration changes are made to the istio-operator deployment.

Jaeger relies on the presence of the Jaeger operator being installed before Maistra.

If available, the Jaeger operator (version 1.13.1) should be installed from the OperatorHub.

Alternatively, to install the Jaeger operator manually, execute the following commands as a privileged user:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc new-project observability # create the project for the jaeger operator
$ oc create -n observability -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/v1.13.1/deploy/crds/jaegertracing_v1_jaeger_crd.yaml
$ oc create -n observability -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/v1.13.1/deploy/service_account.yaml
$ oc create -n observability -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/v1.13.1/deploy/role.yaml
$ oc create -n observability -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/v1.13.1/deploy/role_binding.yaml
$ oc create -n observability -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/v1.13.1/deploy/operator.yaml
----

When the Jaeger operator is running, the output should look similar to the following:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc get pods -n observability
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jaeger-operator-5bcd7ff5df-59msz   1/1     Running   0          4m9s

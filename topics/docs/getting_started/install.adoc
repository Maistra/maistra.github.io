== Istio Installation Guide

This guide provides instructions for installing Maistra into an existing OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) or Origin (OKD) cluster and for creating a standalone, all-in-one origin cluster with Istio

=== Tested Configurations

- link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/prerequisites.html[OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11]/Origin (OKD) 3.11. The link:../add-redhat-registry[Red Hat registry] and link:../311-nodes[nodes] must be configured before installing.
- OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.1
- NOTE: We no longer maintain a version of `oc cluster up` for use with Service Mesh and we do not yet run within an OpenShift Online or OpenShift Dedicated environment.

=== Installing the Istio Operator

The Maistra installation process introduces a Kubernetes operator to manage the installation, update, and removal of the Istio control plane within the istio-system project.

The templates are available at: https://github.com/Maistra/istio-operator/tree/maistra-1.0/deploy/examples

The following steps will install the Maistra operator into an existing installation, these can be executed from any host with access to the cluster.  Please ensure you are logged in as a cluster admin before executing the following

```
oc new-project istio-operator
oc apply -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-1.0/deploy/maistra-operator.yaml
```

== Verifying Installation

The above instructions will create a new deployment within the istio-operator project, executing the operator responsible for managing the state of the Istio control plane through the *ServiceMeshControlPlane*.

To verify the operator is installed correctly, wait for the operator to reach the running state

```
oc get pods -n istio-operator -l name=istio-operator

NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-operator-5cd6bcf645-fvb57   1/1       Running   0          1h
```

== Deploying the Istio Control Plane
Maistra supports the deployment of multiple Istio control planes using *ServiceMeshMemberRoll*
and *ServiceMeshControlPlane* resources. The *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* lists the projects belonging
to the control plane while the *ServiceMeshControlPlane* lists the configuration to use during installation.
*ServiceMeshControlPlane* can be shortened to `smcp` and *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* can be shortened to `smmr`.

=== ServiceMeshMemberRoll
The *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* resource configures which projects belong to a control plane.
Only projects listed in the *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* will be affected by the control plane.
Any number of projects can be added, but a project may not exist in more than one control plane.
This resource must be created in the same project as the *ServicemeshControlPlane* resource
and must be named default. An example resource can be seen below:

{{% notice note %}}
The control plane processes the *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* when: the *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* is created, updated, or deleted,
the *ServicemeshControlPlane* in the same project is created or updated, or a project in the *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* is created or deleted.
{{% /notice %}}


{{< snippet_markdown name="istio_installation_smmr" >}}

=== ServiceMeshControlPlane
In order to deploy the Istio Control Plane, create a *ServiceMeshControlPlane* such as the one in the following example.
The example below uses `istio-system` as the control plane project. For more information on the parameters and their
configuration please see the link:../custom-install[custom installation documentation].

{{< snippet_markdown name="istio_installation_minimal" >}}

Once you have modified the *ServiceMeshControlPlane* to suit your installation you can deploy the resource using the following command,
substituting istio-system if appropriate.

```
oc new-project istio-system
oc create -n istio-system -f <name of file>
```

== Control Plane Templates
Templates follow the same syntax as a *ServiceMeshControlPlane* and allow users to inherit settings in a hierarchical fashion. The operator
comes with a built-in `default` template containing the default settings for OpenShift Service Mesh or Maistra depending on the operator.
To add custom templates, create a ConfigMap called `smcp-templates` in the `openshift-operators` project. This ConfigMap will contain a collection
of templates to use. This ConfigMap must then be mounted in the operator at `/usr/local/share/istio-operator/templates/`.

=== Creating the ConfigMap
To create the ConfigMap, execute the following as a cluster administrator, substituting _templates-directory_ for a directory containing a
collection of *ServiceMeshControlPlane* files to use as templates. The name of the template will match the name of the file. Templates will
inherit from other templates until a template is reached which has an empty template field. Using a name of _default_ will override the
default template when no template is specified in a controlplane.


For example, create a ServiceMeshControlPlane and instead of using `oc apply` to create it in the cluster, save it in a
directory called _templates-directory_. Follow the instructions below to create and configure a ConfigMap using this new
template. Additional templates can be created the same way.

```
 oc create configmap --from-file=templates-directory smcp-templates -n openshift-operators
```
Next, find and edit the operator deloyment in the operator cluster service version to
instruct the operator to use the smcp-templates ConfigMap.

```
oc get clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators | grep 'Service Mesh'
maistra.v1.0.0            Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh   1.0.0                Succeeded

oc edit clusterserviceversion -n openshift-operators maistra.v1.0.0
```

In the editor, add a volume mount and volume as shown below.

```
 deployments:
        - name: istio-operator
          spec:
          ...
                    volumeMounts:
                      - mountPath: /home/istio-operator/.kube/cache/discovery
                        name: discovery-cache
                      - name: smcp-templates
                        mountPath: /usr/local/share/istio-operator/templates/
          ...
                volumes:
                  - emptyDir:
                      medium: Memory
                    name: discovery-cache
                  - name: smcp-templates
                    configMap:
                      name: smcp-templates
```

Templates can now be referenced by adding a *template* parameter to the *ServiceMeshControlPlane*.
```
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: minimal-install
spec:
  template: default
```


== Uninstalling Maistra

[[remove_control_plane]]

=== Removing the Control Plane

{{% notice note %}}
Subsitute the proper project below if the controlplane was created in a project other than istio-system.
{{% /notice %}}

The following steps will remove Istio from an existing installation. It can be executed by any user with access to delete the CustomResource.

To get the name of the installed *ServiceMeshControlPlane*, type:
```
oc get servicemeshcontrolplanes -n istio-system
```

This resource can now be deleted as follows:
```
oc delete smcp -n istio-system <name_of_cr>
oc delete project istio-system
```

The removal of the CustomResource will tell the Istio operator to begin uninstalling everything it installed.

==== Removing the Maistra Operator
In order to cleanly remove the operator execute the following:

```
oc delete -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-1.0/deploy/maistra-operator.yaml
oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration/istio-operator.servicemesh-resources.maistra.io
```

The *istio-operator* project can now be removed.

```
oc delete project istio-operator
```

== Upgrading from a Pre-Existing Installation

To upgrade Istio, please <<remove_control_plane, remove *ServiceMeshControlPlane*>>  and then create a one. The operator will upgrade appropriately.

To upgrade the operator, please first <<remove_operator, remove the operator>> and then reinstall it. Note that Istio must be removed before the operator.

{{% notice note %}}
If the operator was removed before the *ServiceMeshControlPlane*, you can uninstall the control plane manually. Using the instructions below
{{% /notice %}}

```
oc delete csr istio-sidecar-injector.istio-system
oc get crd  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete crd
oc get mutatingwebhookconfigurations  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations
oc get validatingwebhookconfiguration  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration
oc get clusterroles  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterroles
oc get clusterrolebindings  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterrolebindings
```

== Istio Installation Guide

This guide provides instructions for installing Maistra into an existing OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) or Origin (OKD) cluster and for creating a standalone, all-in-one origin cluster with Istio

=== Tested Configurations

- link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/prerequisites.html[OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11]/Origin (OKD) 3.11. The link:../add-redhat-registry[Red Hat registry] and link:../311-nodes[nodes] must be configured before installing.
- OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.1
- NOTE: We no longer maintain a version of `oc cluster up` for use with Service Mesh and we do not yet run within an OpenShift Online or OpenShift Dedicated environment.

=== Installing the Istio Operator

The Maistra installation process introduces a Kubernetes operator to manage the installation, update, and removal of the Istio control plane within the istio-system project.

The templates are available at: https://github.com/Maistra/istio-operator/tree/maistra-1.0/deploy/examples

The following steps will install the Maistra operator into an existing installation, these can be executed from any host with access to the cluster.  Please ensure you are logged in as a cluster admin before executing the following

```
oc new-project istio-operator
oc apply -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-1.0/deploy/maistra-operator.yaml
```

== Verifying Installation

The above instructions will create a new deployment within the istio-operator project, executing the operator responsible for managing the state of the Istio control plane through the *ServiceMeshControlPlane*.

To verify the operator is installed correctly, wait for the operator to reach the running state

```
oc get pods -n istio-operator -l name=istio-operator

NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-operator-5cd6bcf645-fvb57   1/1       Running   0          1h
```

=== Deploying the Istio Control Plane


{{% notice warning %}}
Single-tenant mode is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Running in single tenant mode may cause issues with OpenShift upgrades and restarts.
{{% /notice %}}

Maistra supports both multi-tenant installations and single-tenant installations.
In a single-tenant installation, a single control plane is used for the entire cluster.
In a multi-tenant installation, multiple control planes can be deployed in a cluster,
with each control plane allowing access to only projects listed in a *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* resource belonging to that controlplane.

{{% notice warning %}}
Multi-tenant control plane installations cannot be used in conjunction with a cluster-wide control plane installation, i.e. all installations must be mult-tenant or a single, cluster-wide installation must be used.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice warning %}}
The proxy-init image must be changed to maistra/proxy-init-centos7 if running on a RHEL 7 host.  More details can be found in the link:../custom-install[custom installation documentation]
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
Maistra supports a shorthand of *smcp* for *ServiceMeshControlPlane* and *smmr* for *ServiceMeshMemberRoll*.
{{% /notice %}}

==== Single-Tenant Installation


Single tenant mode is disabled by default. To enable it, set multitenant to false in your *ServiceMeshControlPlane*. In order to deploy the Istio Control Plane, we need to create a *ServiceMeshControlPlane* such as the one in the following example. In our examples, we use the istio-system project. For more information on the parameters and their configuration please see the link:../custom-install[custom installation documentation].

{{< snippet_markdown name="istio_installation_minimal" >}}

Once you have modified the *ServiceMeshControlPlane* to suit your installation you can deploy the resource using the following command, substituting istio-system if appropriate.

```
oc new-project istio-system
oc create -n istio-system -f <name of file>
```

==== Multi-Tenant Installation
Multitenancy is enabled by default. To use it, create a project to contain the control plane, and create the *ServiceMeshControlPlane* in that project.

===== ServiceMeshMemberRoll
The *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* resource configures which projects belong to a control plane.
Only projects listed in the *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* will be affected by the control plane.
Any number of projects can be added, but a project may not exist in more than one control plane.
This resource must be created in the same project as the *ServicemeshControlPlane* resource
and must be named default. An example resource can be seen below:

{{< snippet_markdown name="istio_installation_smmr" >}}

{{% notice note %}}
The control plane processes the *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* when: the *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* is created, updated, or deleted,
the *ServicemeshControlPlane* in the same project is created or updated, or a project in the *ServiceMeshMemberRoll* is created or deleted.

== Uninstalling Maistra

[[remove_control_plane]]

=== Removing the Control Plane

{{% notice note %}}
Subsitute the proper project below if the controlplane was created in a project other than istio-system.
{{% /notice %}}

The following steps will remove Istio from an existing installation. It can be executed by any user with access to delete the CustomResource.

To get the name of the installed *ServiceMeshControlPlane*, type:
```
oc get servicemeshcontrolplanes -n istio-system
```

This resource can now be deleted as follows:
```
oc delete smcp -n istio-system <name_of_cr>
oc delete project istio-system
```

The removal of the CustomResource will tell the Istio operator to begin uninstalling everything it installed.

==== Removing the Maistra Operator
In order to cleanly remove the operator execute the following:

```
oc delete -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-1.0/deploy/maistra-operator.yaml
```

The *istio-operator* project can now be removed.

```
oc delete project istio-operator
```

== Upgrading from a Pre-Existing Installation

To upgrade Istio, please <<remove_control_plane, remove *ServiceMeshControlPlane*>>  and then create a one. The operator will upgrade appropriately.

To upgrade the operator, please first <<remove_operator, remove the operator>> and then reinstall it. Note that Istio must be removed before the operator.

{{% notice note %}}
If the operator was removed before the *ServiceMeshControlPlane*, you can uninstall the control plane manually. Using the instructions below
{{% /notice %}}

```
oc delete csr istio-sidecar-injector.istio-system
oc get crd  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete crd
oc get mutatingwebhookconfigurations  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations
oc get validatingwebhookconfiguration  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration
oc get clusterroles  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterroles
oc get clusterrolebindings  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterrolebindings
```

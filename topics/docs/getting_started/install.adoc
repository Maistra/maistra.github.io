== Istio Installation Guide
:toc:

This guide provides instructions for installing Maistra into an existing OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) or Origin (OKD) cluster and for creating a standalone, all-in-one origin cluster with Istio

{{% notice note %}}
The installation instructions for Maistra have changed significantly since Maistra 0.9. The instructions for Maistra 0.9 are link:https://maistra-0-9-0.maistra.io/docs/getting_started/install/[here].
{{% /notice %}}

=== Supported Configurations

- OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11 (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/prerequisites.html)
- OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.0
- Origin (OKD) 3.11
- istiooc (https://github.com/Maistra/origin/releases/tag/v3.11.0%2Bmaistra-0.10.0)
- NOTE: OpenShift Online and OpenShift Dedicated are not supported in the 0.10.0 Istio Tech Preview

== Preparing the Installation

Before Istio can be installed into an existing installation it is necessary to make a number of changes to the master configuration and each of the schedulable nodes.  These changes will enable features required within Istio and also ensure Elasticsearch will function correctly.

{{% notice info %}}
The master/node updates discussed below are no longer necessary in OCP/OKD 4.0
{{% /notice %}}

=== Updating the Master

If manual sidecar injection (i.e. kube-inject) is used this section may be skipped.

To enable the automatic injection of the Istio sidecar we first need to modify the master configuration on each master to include support for webhooks and signing of Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).
Then each individual Deployment requiring automatic injection needs to be modified.

First, make the following changes on each master within your installation.

- Change to the directory containing the master configuration file (e.g. /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml)
- Create a file named master-config.patch with the following contents

[source,yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    MutatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
    ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
----

- Within the same directory issue the following commands:

```
cp -p master-config.yaml master-config.yaml.prepatch
oc ex config patch master-config.yaml.prepatch -p "$(cat master-config.patch)" > master-config.yaml
master-restart api
master-restart controllers
```

==== Updating the Nodes

In order to run the Elasticsearch application it is necessary to make a change to the kernel configuration on each node, this change will be handled through the `sysctl` service.

Make the following changes on each node within your installation

- Create a file named `/etc/sysctl.d/99-elasticsearch.conf` with the following contents:

`vm.max_map_count = 262144`

- Execute the following command:

```
sysctl vm.max_map_count=262144
```
== Installing Maistra
=== Installing the Istio Operator

The Maistra installation process introduces a Kubernetes operator to manage the installation of the Istio control plane within the istio-system namespace.  This operator defines and monitors a custom resource related to the deployment, update and deletion of the Istio control plane.

The templates are available at: https://github.com/Maistra/istio-operator/tree/maistra-0.10/deploy/examples

The following steps will install the Maistra operator into an existing installation, these can be executed from any host with access to the cluster.  Please ensure you are logged in as a cluster admin before executing the following

{{% notice info %}}
The OpenShift Master Public URL should be configured to match the public URL of your OpenShift Console, this parameter is required by the Fabric8 launcher.
{{% /notice %}}

```
oc new-project istio-operator
oc new-project istio-system
oc apply -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/istio_v1alpha1_installation_crd.yaml
oc apply -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/istio_v1alpha3_controlplane_crd.yaml
oc apply -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/operator.yaml
oc apply -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/rbac.yaml
oc apply -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/service_account.yaml
```

== Verifying Installation

The above instructions will create a new deployment within the istio-operator project, executing the operator responsible for managing the state of the Istio control plane through the custom resource.

To verify the operator is installed correctly, wait for the operator to reach the running state

```
oc get pods -n istio-operator -l name=istio-operator

NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-operator-5cd6bcf645-fvb57   1/1       Running   0          1h
```



=== Deploying the Istio Control Plane

{{% notice info %}}
The installation yaml has changed significantly in Maistra 0.10. See link:https://github.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/tree/maistra-0.10/istio[here] for older examples.
{{% /notice %}}

In order to deploy the Istio Control Plane we need to create a custom resource such as the one in the following example which demonstrates the configuration options supported by the operator.  The custom resource *must* be deployed into the `istio-system` namespace. For more information on the parameters and their configuration please see the link:../custom-install[Custom Installation Documentation].

{{< snippet_markdown name="istio_installation_minimal" >}}

Once you have modified the custom resource to suit your installation you can deploy the resource using the following command

```
oc create -n istio-system -f <name of file>
```

{{< snippet_markdown name="verify_install" >}}

== Uninstalling Maistra

[[remove_control_plane]]

=== Removing the Control Plane

The following steps will remove Istio from an existing installation. It can be executed by any user with access to delete the CustomResource.

To get the name of the installed custom resource, do:
```
oc get controlplanes -n istio-system
```

This resource can now be deleted as follows:
```
oc delete -n istio-system -f <name_of_cr>
```

The removal of the CustomResource will tell the Istio operator to begin uninstalling everything it installed.

[[remove_operator]] 

=== Removing the Operator

In order to cleanly remove the operator execute the following:

```
oc delete -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/istio_v1alpha1_installation_crd.yaml
oc delete -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/istio_v1alpha3_controlplane_crd.yaml
oc delete -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/operator.yaml
oc delete -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/rbac.yaml
oc delete -n istio-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio-operator/maistra-0.10/deploy/service_account.yaml
```

The `istio-operator` and `istio-system` projects can now be removed.

```
oc delete project istio-system
oc delete project istio-operator
```

== Upgrading from a Pre-Existing Installation

To upgrade Istio, please <<remove_control_plane, remove the custom resource>>  and then create a new custom resource. The operator will upgrade appropriately. 

To upgrade the operator, please first <<remove_operator, remote the operator>> and then reinstall it. Note that Istio must be removed before the operator.

{{% notice note %}}
If the operator was removed before the custom resource, you can uninstall the control plane manually. Using the instructions below
{{% /notice %}}

```
oc delete project istio-system
oc delete csr istio-sidecar-injector.istio-system
oc get crd  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete crd
oc get mutatingwebhookconfigurations  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations
oc get validatingwebhookconfiguration  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration
oc get clusterroles  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterroles
oc get clusterrolebindings  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterrolebindings
```
